        Define the number of columns you want your dataset to have (number of rows in the UI) by clicking on ‘+’ to add a new column. <br/>
        <br/>
        Give a name to each column ‘Field name’ and select a data type from the drop-down menu.<br/>
        <br/>
        When the data is generated, a table with the test data will be displayed. You can change the order of the columns by dragging and dropping the rows in the UI before exporting your dataset.<br/>

        The generated data can be exported in various formats, including CSV, JSON, and SQL. 
        This facilitates the integration of the generated data into different systems and applications, 
        allowing users to work with the data in the format that best suits their needs.
